MIsoCor
==============

Intoruction
-------
MIsoCor is a software tool for the correction for natural abundance in isotope labeling experiments. It is modified from IsoCor, which was published a few years ago. 



Purpose
-------
1. To fix the issues that IsoCor has with efficiency and linear regression. 
2. To provide a MATLAB tool that can easily be incorporated into exisiting pipelines for metabolic tracer and flux analysis. 



Tutorial
-------
For anyone who uses this tool, please cite the original IsoCor application note as well.
